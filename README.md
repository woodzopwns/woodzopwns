Hi, I'm Liam Woods.

You've probably gotten here from a job application or a letter of recommendation, or something similar. Attached to this GitHub is my final year thesis project,
this is a sequential nerual network ensemble application which classifies player data from the video game OldSchool RuneScape.

There may also be others added over-time as I complete personal projects.

Thank you.
